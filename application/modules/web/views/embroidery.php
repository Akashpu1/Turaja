<h5>CHIKANKARI</h5>
<p>Chikankari embroidery, known as Shadow work by using herringbone stitch from the wrong side of the fabric and creates shadow on the right side and at the same imparts an outline to the motif. It is an integral part of the life and culture of Lucknow and recognized, worldwide. The name Chikan has been derived from the Persian word 'Chakin' or 'Chikeen' meaning a kind of cloth with needle work. Chikan is said to have originated as a court craft during the reign of Mughal emperor Jahangir, by his wife Noor Jahan. Traditionally, the Chikankari was exclusively done on white fabric (known as Tanzeb) using white thread. The motifs are inspired from nature's flora motifs including flowers, jasmine, rose, and birds like peacock, parrots and lace-like patterns. </p>
<p>There are three types of stitches used in chikankari: Flat stitches, such as Taipachi (running stitch), Ghaspatti (fill with petals and leaves), Pechani (running stitch in regular manner), Bakhia (herringbone stitch, done on both side of the fabric) and Thurs (cross stitch done on the right side of the fabric).

<h5>ZARDOZI</h5>
<p>Zardosi embroidery has been in existence in India from the time of the Rigveda. The word 'Zardozi' is made up of two Persian terms, zar+dozi, Zar means gold and Dozi means embroidery and it was also known as Bharatkam of India.</p>

<p>There are two embroidery styles namely Karchobi and Kamdani under Zardozi.

<h4>5. PARSI GARA</h4>
<p>The Parsi gara, in a nutshell, is three things. Indian embroidery with a Persian heritage and a Chinese origin. The Parsi embroidery can be traced back to 650 AD where Persian women undertook the Indian style of clothing. Parsi men travelled to China and brought yards of silk fabric for their women. The gara was a result of inter-cultural amalgamation where the fabric was China's and the embroidery was heavily influenced by India's Hindu and Iran's Zoroastrian cultures.</p>
<h5>Techniques used to create Gara work:</h5>
<p>The main stitches that are all intricately entwined are satin stitch, crewel stitch, stem stitch and French knot. Geometric designs are rarely used and most patterns are influenced by scenes and stories of Chinese origin, such as the bridges, pagodas, boatmen and shrines. The colours comprise of two shades. The base fabric is generally darker with ivory thread work or a pastel coloured textile is embroidered with multicoloured threads.</p>
<h5>How long does it take to make a Gara sari?</h5> 
<p>Depending on the density of the work, it can take anything from three weeks to two months. And when I say two months, I mean six to eight people working on one sari together. </p>
<p>What is the base fabric of the sari? Even though the sari is covered in silk thread embroidery all over, it has a nice flow to it and can be draped well. The original fabric was called ‘Sali Ghaj’, which has very thin lines running through it.</p>
